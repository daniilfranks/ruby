Box 1.1. Technical sophistication

The Ruby on Rails Tutorial is part of the Learn Enough to Be Dangerous family of tutorials, which develop the theme of technical sophistication: the combination of hard and soft skills that make it seem like you can magically solve any technical problem (Figure 1.1). Web development, and computer programming in general, are essential components of technical sophistication, but there’s more to it than that—you also have to know how to click around menu items to learn the capabilities of a particular application, how to clarify a confusing error message by Googling it, or when to give up and just reboot the darn thing.

Because web applications have so many moving parts, they offer ample opportunities to develop your technical sophistication. In the context of Rails web development, some specific examples of technical sophistication include making sure you’re using the right Ruby gem versions, running bundle install or bundle update, and restarting the local webserver if something doesn’t work. (Don’t worry if all this sounds like gibberish; we’ll cover everything mentioned here in the course of completing this tutorial.)

As you proceed through this tutorial, in all likelihood you will occasionally be tripped up by things not immediately working as expected. Although some particularly tricky steps are explicitly highlighted in the text, it is impossible to anticipate all the things that can go wrong. I recommend you embrace these inevitable stumbling blocks as opportunities to work on improving your technical sophistication. Or, as we say in geek speak: It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!
