Box 1.2. Scaffolding: Quicker, easier, more seductive

From the beginning, Rails has benefited from a palpable sense of excitement, starting with the famous 15-minute weblog video by Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson. That video and its successors are a great way to get a taste of Rails’ power, and I recommend watching them. But be warned: they accomplish their amazing fifteen-minute feat using a feature called scaffolding, which relies heavily on generated code, magically created by the Rails generate scaffold command.

When writing a Ruby on Rails tutorial, it is tempting to rely on the scaffolding approach—it’s quicker, easier, more seductive. But the complexity and sheer amount of code in the scaffolding can be utterly overwhelming to a beginning Rails developer; you may be able to use it, but you probably won’t understand it. Following the scaffolding approach risks turning you into a virtuoso script generator with little (and brittle) actual knowledge of Rails.

In the Ruby on Rails Tutorial, we’ll take the (nearly) polar opposite approach: although Chapter 2 will develop a small toy app using scaffolding, the core of the Rails Tutorial is the sample app, which we’ll start writing in Chapter 3. At each stage of developing the sample application, we will write small, bite-sized pieces of code—simple enough to understand, yet novel enough to be challenging. The cumulative effect will be a deeper, more flexible knowledge of Rails, giving you a good background for writing nearly any type of web application.
